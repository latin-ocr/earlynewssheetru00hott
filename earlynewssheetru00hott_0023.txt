and become their property, for evermore.

four thousand of the fix thousand Tartars which
were among them,into the deserts and wildernesses,
who were to destroy every thing far and near by
fire and by sword, up to the very walls of the CityÍ¾
imagining, perchance, that after having visited that
whole distri& with such a calarnity, they would
meet with the same good fortune in the fiege of this

town as they had done before.
